    # What is Short-circuit Operator?
    # Ans:- Short-circuit operators are logical operators (and, or) that stop evaluating expressions as soon as the result is known, which makes the program faster and avoids unnecessary or dangerous computations (like dividing by zero).

    ðŸ”¹ and Operator:
    Evaluates left to right.
    If the first operand is False, it does not evaluate the second one.
    Because in A and B, the result will always be False if A is False.
    Code -
"""
a = False

# Safe due to short-circuit
result = a and (1/0)
print(result)  # Output: False
# Explanation: Since a is False, Python skips evaluating b (which would crash the program).
